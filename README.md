# KittyKafeJava
Welcome to Kitty Kafe! In this game you are Mittens, the hard working cafe owner and sole employee working to pay off your student loan debts. It's a lot of hard work keeping the citizens of Meow-topia well fed, but you're up for the challenge!

## How to Run the Program:

Place all files into a folder titled "src". This will be your working directory. Then set your working directory in the terminal to the src folder. Then run this line:
`javac *.java`
and then run this line:
`java Main`

## How to Play:

To play, click on the Start Button and you'll be taken to the register where two cats are waiting with their order. You can then go to the kitchen by clicking the button on the top right corner. 

In the kitchen, use your mouse to prepare an order by clicking on the items you need. For more details on the clickable objects, you can watch the tutorial in the menu which will show you which objects you can interact with.

Once you have an order ready on your countertop, go back to the register by clicking the top right button and click on the cat to deliver that order to them. If you get it right, you will earn points! If you get it wrong, you will lose a life. You only have 9 lives, and the game ends when you run out of lives. 

Be sure to be quick on the order, these cats are impatient. If you take longer than 25 seconds you won't get any points! If you get the order between 10 and 25 seconds of the cat spawning, you earn 1 point. If you are super speedy and give a cat its order within 10 seconds of spawning, you get a whole 5 points. You can click on the employee cat to see your current lives and score in the terminal.

## Other Important Keys 

To go back to the start menu, press the 't' key on your keyboard. Note, this will not save your current game. To exit the game completely, press the 'e' key on your keyboard. 

## How to Save:

If you want to save your progress, press the 's' key on your keyboard. This saves the current customers and their desired orders, as well as your current score and lives. It does not save your current prepared order. To load your most recent save, press the 'l' key on your keyboard. This feature only works in the regular gamemode. 

## Other Gamemode

Are you tired of seeing different customers and orders? Enter Nerd Mode from the start screen and face the real challenge of your patience. In this mode, all of your customers want one thing and one thing only: seltzer. How long can you fulfill these poor computer scientists' orders? Note that there is no save function in this gamemode, it's all or nothing.
